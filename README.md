## How to Use

You can access the code by simply cloning the repository to your local machine using the following command:


`git clone https://github.com/PradeepVPK/basic-java-programs.git`

To run any of the Java programs, you will need to have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system. You can compile and execute the programs using the following commands:

# Compile the Java program
`javac ProgramName.java`

# Run the Java program
`java ProgramName `

Replace `ProgramName` with the name of the Java file you want to compile and run.
